## About this page...

Mostly this is stuff that comes out of discussions in our [Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/networkautoma-prb3593/shared_invite/zt-25rdfdmyf-qYoYgXEEMs7h_aqwC79Abg) or at our events. It can come from anywhere though, just make sure it is practical and accurate.

## Prior Art

There is a nice, big list of links in NetworkToCode's Github [here](https://github.com/networktocode/awesome-network-automation).

## Other Sources

## TBD...

More info as we get going, for now...
