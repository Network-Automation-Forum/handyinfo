## Software Development Concepts

See the section [above](#network-automation-concepts) for materials focused on network automation. See the [Python](python.md) and [Go](go.md) sections to the left for information on those specific languages.

For general programming principles not necessarily related to networking or automation, see below.

### Online Learning

* [OOP Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns)

### Books

* [The Pragmatic Programmer, 20th Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0135957052/)
    * This is the quintessential programming textbook that takes you from dabbler to professional.
* [A Common-Sense Guide to Data Structures and Algorithms, Second Edition: Level Up Your Core Programming Skills](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1680507222/) - Not too dry.
* [Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/dp/9390727359/) - The detailed one 
* [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Orienter Software](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201633612/)
    * A bit dry. However, despite its age and reference to older technologies, the design concepts covered are timeless. These are critical concepts primarily when developing complex and sizeable object-oriented software, if you're doing that for some reason.
* [O'Reilly Web Application Security: Exploitation and Countermeasures for Modern Web Applications](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1098143930/)
    * Making a network automation web application, such as a self-service portal, without dedicated web developers? Guess what, time to be an expert in web application security too! You're so talented.

## Team Dynamics and DevOps Principles

* **(Slides)** ["Building a NetDevOps Team" Presentation](https://internet2.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/030724-Building-a-NetDevOps-Team.pdf) - Provided at Internet2 Community Exchange 2024
* **(Book)** [The Mythical Man Month: Essays on Software Engineering, Anniversary Edition](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0201835959)
    * The Surgical Team essay is pertinent to team dynamics and composition.
    * The rest of the book is filled with other enlightening ideas on software development. Frederick Brooks goes into why the Man-Month, the unit of measurement of for the amount of work one person can complete in one month, is mythical.
    * If you've heard of Brook's Law, this is where it comes from. If you haven't, Brook's Law proposes that ["adding manpower to a late software project makes it later."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks%27s_law)
